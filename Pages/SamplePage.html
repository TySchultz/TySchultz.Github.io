                            <span>Tell us what you’re working on, why it's going to be amazing, or and your vision for your path forward. Anything at all to get the conversation started. Or just to say hello! </span>
                        </p>
                        <p><span>We will get back to you so fast you will think we are a part robot. We love asking questions. Like lots of questions. Let's get to know each other and figure out how were going to take over the world. Or you know, craft an amazing product. Real talk.</span></p>
                        <p><b>What We Do</b></p>
                        <p><span>We're a startup focused design agency. Which really means that we have the ability to move at the crazy hyperspeed you're flying at. We have everything needed to handle your project from start to finish.</span></p>

                         <p><b>The Process</b></p>
                        <p><span> We structure our work into sprints. Think Usain Bolt, but for design. Two one week long sprints crossing the finish line with all of the documents you need to take to your developers. </span></p>
                        <p><span> Developed at <a href="">Google Ventures</a>, a design sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers</span></p>
                                          <p><span> We adapted this into a two week long process. The first week is focused on discovery & vision. The second week is for creating, producing, and finalizing.</span></p>

                        <p><b>FAQs</b></p>
                        <p><em><span >Q: What kind of designs do you make?</span></em></p>
                        <p><span>A: All kinds, from simple utility apps that do one thing better than anyone else to a full scale social network that needs everything in the kitchen sink.</span></p>
                        <p><em><span >Q: What kind of clients do you prefer?</span></em></p>
                        <p><span>A: We are happy to with small developer, massive companies, or anyone in the middle. We love clients who are increbuly focused on their vision and determined to make something amazing. also, clients with money.</span></p>
                        <p><em><span >Q: f we work with you, does my project have to include that shade of blue y use everywhere?</span></em></p>
                        <p><span>A: Great question but no.  in case you were wondering it is #0EA3DD Cerulean blue. We fell in love with this color a long long time ago and it sneaks into a lot of what we do because of its ability to blend into the background. Every project is different, we adapt and configure based on your projects needs.</span></p>
                        <p><em><span >Q: Why do people come to you? </span></em></p>
                        <p><span>A: we love creating and crafting amazing products. When you focus with real passion and care, that makes its way to the user. They notice that difference. Ohh, and cost. We're f***ing cheap.</span></p>
                        <p><em><span >Q: How much does it cost?</span></em></p>
                        <p><span>A: So, about $100k. Just kidding, but the point is that this costs real money. Typically, $3k is what it takes. We move quick, focus on the things that matter, the cost is really only there so we can keep doing what we love. </span></p>
                        <p><em><span >Q: So $3k, for our whole design? </span></em></p>
                        <p><span>A: Yupp! Will our designs hold up until IPO? No, hopefully not! Great products consistenly adapt and change with their users. What we provide is the ability to take your focus elsewhere for a year or two. Build a great team, Grow your user base, focus on improving. By the time our design needs changing you will have plenty of resources to do so.  </span></p>
                        <p><em><span >Q: How long does it take?</span></em></p>
                        <p><span>A: from start to finish we aim for two weeks. Why? We created a structure that involves two one week design sprints. This allows us to remove all of the fluff and get down to what really matters, what is truly needed to build your foundation. Any longer allows scope creep and unneeded additions. </span></p>
                        <p><em><span >Q: Is that it?</span></em></p>
                        <p><span>A: Yes, that’s it.</span></p>
