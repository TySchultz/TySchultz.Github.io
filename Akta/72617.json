We have a lot of work that is left to be done ahead of us. He recognizes that. He's deeply engaged in that work,\" The State Dept. said.<br><br>The main take away is his frustrations center around his inability to staff up at the State Department without White House interference after Trump promised Tillerson he would have control over his department, a friend of Tillerson who is in touch regularly told CNN. There are lots of frustrations which are apparent: personnel, Jared Kushner's outsized role, President Donald Trump undercutting him on several issues and Trump's general approach to foreign policy of inflicting chaos and confusion - and the list goes on, the friend said, adding \"It's becoming a death by one thousand little insults.\"",
